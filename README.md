Septajawn
=========

A simple webapp dedicated to easily find schedule times for Septa's subway system. The primary goal of the app is to be as accessbile as possible. This is achieved with: an intutive UI, lightweight and responsive to operate on many devices and no monetary barrier.

Currently, the best way to find subway times online is through Septa's website (ex: http://www.septa.org/schedules/transit/w/MFL_1.htm). These matrices of times have obvious UI/UX and aren't adequately accessible on any devices, including desktops. Other alternatives include native apps to iOS and Android. However, these solutions require users to download an app (not always free) and aren't cross platform, which shrinks the possible userbase.

To me, this project served as an exercise to learn Javascript, jQuery, fundamentals of mobile webapp design. And hopefully the best practices as well. Admitedly, some of the code might seem hackish.

IMPORTANT: Septajawn is still a work in progress, but there is a working prototype (http://willvedd.github.io/Septajawn)

Intended future implementations:
-Adding express lines to BSL
-Favorites option that will remember one or two stations with cookies
-Autoscrolling to current/highlighted time
-Optimized code to perform adequately on older devices
-ADA compliance
